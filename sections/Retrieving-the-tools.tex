As mentioned in Section~\ref{sec:Overview} useful tools and configurations
are provided in the CD-ROM:
\begin{itemize}
\item   A fully-fledged cross-compiler for the \PPC\ architecture
        can be found in the \FileName{pkgs} directory:
        \FileName{mtwk-lnx-powerpc-gcc-3.4.3-glibc-2.3.3-0.28-1.i686.rpm};

\item   The \FileName{images} directory contains all the binary
        objects to be loaded on the \emph{flash memory} of the
        board:
        \begin{itemize}
        \item   A pre-compiled binary image of the \emph{kernel}:
                \FileName{uimage};
        \item   An image of the \emph{\BusyBox-based filesystem}:
                \FileName{rootfs.ext2.gz.uboot};
        \item   The \emph{device tree blob}:
                \FileName{mpc8313erdb.dtb}
        \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

The configurations files they can be found inside the
\FileName{ltib.tar.gz} tarball, in a directory named \FileName{config}.
They can be used in case of partial or total rebuilding of the system.

\Warn{}{
    If an upgrade to newer versions of the software is required, please
    mind the fact that old configuration files are usually not suitable
    for new versions of the software
}
