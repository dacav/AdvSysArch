When I booted the board with the untampered factory settings I noticed
that the installed \BusyBox\ + \Linux\ system is provided with a
\NetCat-like tool\footnote{\url{http://nc110.sourceforge.net/}}.

The very first test I ran was trying to execute a simple
\emph{Hello World} C program on the board as follows:
\begin{enumerate}

    \item   Cross-compile the program:

\begin{lstlisting}
    host$ cat > hello.c << EOF
    > #include <stdio.h>
    > int main ()
    > {
    >     printf("Hello world!\n");
    >     return 0;
    > }
    > EOF
    host$ $ CC=powerpc-linux-gcc make hello
    powerpc-linux-gcc   hello.o   -o hello
\end{lstlisting}

    \item   Feed a \NetCat\ in server mode with the executable:

\begin{lstlisting}
    host$ nc -l 9000 < hello
\end{lstlisting}

    \item   Retrieve the program from the board and execute it:

\begin{lstlisting}
    board$ nc 192.168.1.1 > hello
    board$ chmod +x ./hello
    board$ ./hello
    Hello world
\end{lstlisting}

\end{enumerate}

\Warn{Interrupt from keyboard}{
    The installed \BusyBox\ + \Linux\ system may not support the
    \emph{termination from keyboard} sequence (\Command{CTRL+C}); this is
    probably due to the serial interface. It's a good practice to launch
    programs like \NetCat, which waits for some event, as \emph{background
    process}.

    Also if you plan to test the network with \Command{ping}, for the same
    reason I suggest to use the \Command{-c} option in order to get a
    bounded execution.

This technique is a very simple way of running a program on the board, but
since the filesystem works in RAM, the program will be lost at the first
board reboot. On the other hand this doesn't require to manipulate the
system image stored in the flash memory, so it's very quick.

By using this trick you should be able to achieve software testing in a
convenient way, while the flashing operation can be delayed to the
deployment phase.
